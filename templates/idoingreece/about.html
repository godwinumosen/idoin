              <h3>We Know Exactly Why You're Here</h3>
              <p class="lead">You've seen the photographs. The clifftop ceremonies. The bougainvillea. The
                  light. You've sat with a glass of wine and a laptop open to a tab called 'Greece wedding
                  venues' and felt something shift, a quiet certainty that this is where it has to happen.
                  We know that feeling. We've felt it too. It's precisely why idoingreece.com exists.

              <h4>The Wedding That Started Everything</h4>
              <p>I have worked in events for over 17 years, managing fundraising events for UK charities,
                  coordinating complex programmes, working with suppliers and stakeholders under
                  pressure. I know what goes into making an event extraordinary. I know the difference
                  between a vendor who is merely competent and one who is genuinely passionate about
                  what they do.
                  Planning our wedding in Crete was, without question, the most joyful professional
                  experience of my life.
                  Our planner was exceptional. Our vendors, the florist, the photographer, the team who
                  made every detail feel considered and personal, were extraordinary. What struck me most
                  was not their skill, though that was undeniable. It was their passion. Every single person we
                  worked with cared deeply about our wedding. They were invested in it. They wanted it to be
                  as beautiful and meaningful for us as we did.</p>
